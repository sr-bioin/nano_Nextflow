<h2>Nextflow pipeline for bacterial whole genome sequence analysis using Nanopore data</h2>

<h3>Software used in the pipeline.</h3>

**FastQC** is widely used and is robust, efficient, and versatile quality control software for a varied range of raw genetic data. It outputs a quality report which can be viewed to give an indication on how good the respective reads are. For more information, please visit the FastQC website.

**MultiQC** is used create a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples. It reports can describe multiple analysis steps and large numbers of samples within a single plot, and multiple analysis tools making it ideal for routine fast quality control. For more information, please visit the MultiQC website.

**NanoPlot** Nanoplot is a plotting tool for long read sequencing data and alignments. For more information, please check its website: https://biocontainers.pro/tools/nanoplot and https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot.

**Flye** <br>
Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale assemblies. For more information, please visit https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye.

**Prokka** <br>
It is a software tool to annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes quickly and produce standards-compliant output files. It identifies features of interest in a set of genomic DNA sequences, and labelling them with useful information. For more information, please visit the Prokka website.

**QUAST** <br>
It is a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies by computing various metrics and works both with and without reference genomes. It produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. For more information, please visit the Quast website.

**Abricate** <br>
It is a tool for mass screening of contigs for antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. It comes bundled with multiple databases: NCBI, CARD, ARG-ANNOT, Resfinder, MEGARES, EcOH, PlasmidFinder, Ecoli_VF and VFDB. For more information, please visit https://github.com/tseemann/abricate.
